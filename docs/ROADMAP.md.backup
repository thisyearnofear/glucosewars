# GlucoseWars Roadmap: User-Centric Personalization

## ✅ What We've Built

Core game engine complete: tiered progression (3 tiers × 30/60/90s), classic/life game modes, swipe/tap controls, combo system, player progression tracking, onboarding flows, health profile system, results screens with honest messaging. 

**Phase 1 Progress (Weeks 1-5 COMPLETE):**
- ✅ Week 1-2: User Mode Selection - Modal selector with Personal/Caregiver/Curious modes, persistent storage
- ✅ Week 2-3: Personalized Onboarding - Mode-specific intro steps with consistent design
- ✅ Week 3-4: Results Messaging - Tier-specific hero text on victory screens
- ✅ Week 4-5: In-Game Reflections - Mode-aware insights with science facts during gameplay

---

## 🚀 Phase 1: User-Centric Personalization (4-6 weeks)

**Why:** Current game assumes all players manage their own glucose. Reality: many users are caregivers, family members, or learning for general education. Personalizing the narrative keeps the same game engaging for different user types.

### 1.1 User Mode Selection (Week 1-2) ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Players define their relationship to diabetes for personalized experience

**Implemented:**
- ✅ Modal: "Choose Your Role" (appears once at first launch)
- ✅ Three persistent options:
  - 👤 **Personal** - Managing my own glucose
  - 👨‍👩‍👧 **Caregiver** - Supporting someone with diabetes
  - 📚 **Curious** - Learning about glucose/diabetes
- ✅ Selection stored in `usePlayerProgress` via `setUserMode()` (never ask again)
- ✅ Type-safe: `UserMode` type + `UserModeConfig` for single source of truth
- ✅ Enhanced `MainMenu.tsx` to show selector when `userMode === null`

**Files changed:**
- `types/game.ts` - Added `UserMode` + `UserModeConfig` interface
- `constants/userModes.ts` - NEW - Central configuration
- `hooks/usePlayerProgress.ts` - Added `userMode` state + `setUserMode()`
- `components/game/MainMenu.tsx` - Enhanced to show mode selector
- `app/index.tsx` - Pass `userModeSelected` prop to MainMenu

**Why it matters:** Caregiver mode is high-engagement (emotional driver) and underserved market.

---

### 1.2 Personalized Onboarding (Week 2-3) ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Mode-specific intro steps for each user type

**Implemented:**
- ✅ `getModeIntroStep()` function - Generates mode-specific opening step
- ✅ Dynamic step titles: Personal/Caregiver/Curious (with icons 💪 ❤️ 🧠)
- ✅ Mode-specific narrative text in opening
- ✅ Integrated into Onboarding flow - prepends intro before existing tutorial
- ✅ Maintains all existing animations and design patterns

**Design consistency:**
- Same color scheme: Theme colors per game mode (amber/gold)
- Same typography: Bold title, subtitle, content text styles
- Same animations: Pulse emoji, fade/scale transitions
- Same spacing & borders: Rounded 12px, consistent padding

**Files changed:**
- `components/game/Onboarding.tsx` - Added `getModeIntroStep()` + `userMode` prop
- `app/index.tsx` - Pass `userMode` from progress to Onboarding

---

### 1.3 Mode-Specific Results & Messaging (Week 3-4) ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Personalized results screen messaging per user type

**Implemented:**
- ✅ `getModeSpecificMessage()` function - Returns mode + tier-specific hero text
- ✅ Tier-specific narratives:
  - **Tier 2 Personal:** "YOU MANAGED" | **Tier 2 Caregiver:** "YOU MANAGED THEIR GLUCOSE"
  - **Tier 3 Personal:** "YOUR MASTERY UNLOCKED" | **Tier 3 Caregiver:** "YOUR UNDERSTANDING DEEPENED"
- ✅ Hero text displays in results card under "VICTORY!" header
- ✅ Gold color (#fbbf24) matches victory theme

**Design consistency:**
- Matches existing results card aesthetic
- Gold accent text (victory color)
- Positioned under main result header (consistent layout)
- Font weight & size match surrounding content

**Files changed:**
- `constants/userModes.ts` - Enhanced with `narrative` object
- `components/game/ResultsScroll.tsx` - Added `getModeSpecificMessage()` + display
- `app/index.tsx` - Pass `userMode` to ResultsScroll

---

### 1.4 In-Game Reflection Points (Week 4-5)

**Personal Mode:** Same current flow (learning is about managing self)

**Caregiver Mode:** Same mechanics, different narrative
- Health profile: "Tell us about [loved one]"
- Questions: relation type (child, parent, partner, sibling, friend)
- Framing: "Understanding their health" vs "Managing your health"
- Early empathy setup

**Deliverable:** Conditional onboarding steps per mode

---

### 1.3 Mode-Specific Results & Messaging (Week 3-4)

**Personal Mode - Tier2:**
```
💡 YOU MANAGED: 120 mg/dL
Your glucose depends on:
🍽️ Food • ⏰ Timing • 🏃 Exercise • 😴 Sleep • 😰 Stress
ACTION: Log meals for 3 days, notice patterns
```

**Caregiver Mode - Tier2:**
```
💡 YOU MANAGED THEIR GLUCOSE: 120 mg/dL
Now you understand:
✓ Why they need insulin/medication
✓ How timing affects their body
✓ Why "just eating healthy" isn't enough
ACTION: Ask them how daily management feels
```

**Personal Mode - Tier3:**
```
🏆 ADVANCED PATTERNS MASTERED
You've learned: timing matters, balance > restriction, listen to your body
NEXT: Talk with your doctor about adjusting
```

**Caregiver Mode - Tier3:**
```
🏆 ADVANCED UNDERSTANDING ACHIEVED
You now know: insulin complexity, why scenarios are hard, how to support
NEXT: Have deeper conversation with loved one
```

**Deliverable:** Message templates, conditional rendering per mode

---

### 1.4 In-Game Reflection Points (Week 4-5) ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Weave learning into gameplay, not just end screens

**Implemented:**
- ✅ `MODE_REFLECTIONS` config in `constants/userModes.ts` - centralized reflection library
- ✅ `getReflectionMessage()` helper - retrieves mode-specific insight
- ✅ Five reflection triggers:
  - `ally_consumed`: Good food eaten (Personal/Caregiver/Curious specific)
  - `enemy_rejected`: Bad food refused
  - `balanced_choice`: General balance achieved
  - `pairing`: Food pairing strategy (future)
  - `optimal_swipe`: Perfect directional choice
- ✅ Probabilistic display (50% for consume/reject, 20% for optimal) - avoids spam
- ✅ Enhanced `GameState` with `announcementScience` field
- ✅ Mode-specific messages with science facts:
  - **Personal:** "You paired carbs with protein - smart! Protein slows glucose absorption."
  - **Caregiver:** "See the glucose spike from carbs? Their insulin works 15 mins later."
  - **Curious:** "Whole grains release glucose slowly—stable energy. Fiber reduces spikes by 50%."
- ✅ Cyan/blue themed display in BattleScreen (reflection color)
- ✅ Extended announcement duration (2.5s) for educational content

**Design consistency:**
- Cyan/blue color (#06b6d4) distinguishes reflections from success/error
- Science text styled as italic secondary text (gray-100)
- 💡 emoji prefix for visual emphasis
- Integrates seamlessly into existing announcement system

**Files changed:**
- `constants/userModes.ts` - Added `MODE_REFLECTIONS` + `ReflectionMessage` interface
- `types/game.ts` - Added `'reflection'` type + `announcementScience` field
- `hooks/useBattleGame.ts` - Import reflection system, add triggers after consume/reject/optimal
- `components/game/BattleScreen.tsx` - Display science fact in announcement
- `app/index.tsx` - Pass `userMode` to useBattleGame

**Deliverable:** In-game reflection system with mode-aware insights and science facts

---

### 1.5 Mode-Specific Plot Twists (Week 5-6) ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Filter plot twist selection by user mode to provide contextually relevant scenarios

**Implemented:**
- ✅ **Mode-specific plot twist sets:** Different scenarios per user mode
  - **Personal Mode:** Real scenarios (stress, exercise, timing challenges) → self-management focus
  - **Caregiver Mode:** Caregiver scenarios (school day, sick day, sports, travel) → understanding compound complexity
  - **Curious Mode:** Educational events → learning opportunities
- ✅ **Mode-filtered selection:** `triggerPlotTwist()` function filters by user mode
- ✅ **Educational content delivery:** Bonus condition text displayed as science facts
- ✅ **Maintains experience:** Same mechanics, personalized narrative

**Examples:**
- Personal: "Stressful Call! - Cortisol spiking = glucose rises without eating."
- Caregiver: "School Day! - This is why they check blood sugar often."
- Curious: "Insulin Lesson! - Insulin helps cells use glucose for energy."

**Design consistency:**
- Purple theme for plot twist announcements (existing style)
- Educational content displayed as science facts in announcement
- Integrates with existing announcement system seamlessly

**Files changed:**
- `constants/gameConfig.ts` - Created `MODE_PLOT_TWISTS` with mode-specific sets
- `hooks/useBattleGame.ts` - Enhanced `triggerPlotTwist()` to filter by user mode
- `components/game/BattleScreen.tsx` - Enhanced to display plot twist science facts
- `components/game/LifeModeHUD.tsx` - Updated LifeModeFooter to support all announcement types
- `types/game.ts` - Extended `PlotTwistType` with new IDs

**Deliverable:** Mode-filtered plot twist selection with contextually relevant scenarios
