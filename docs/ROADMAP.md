# GlucoseWars Roadmap: User-Centric Personalization

## ✅ What We've Built

Core game engine complete: tiered progression (3 tiers × 30/60/90s), classic/life game modes, swipe/tap controls, combo system, player progression tracking, onboarding flows, health profile system, results screens with honest messaging.

**Phase 1 Progress (COMPLETE):**
- ✅ User Mode Selection - Modal selector with Personal/Caregiver/Curious modes
- ✅ Personalized Onboarding - Mode-specific intro steps with consistent design  
- ✅ Results Messaging - Tier-specific hero text on victory screens
- ✅ In-Game Reflections - Mode-aware insights with science facts during gameplay

---

## 🚀 Phase 1: User-Centric Personalization (COMPLETED)

**Why:** Current game assumes all players manage their own glucose. Reality: many users are caregivers, family members, or learning for general education.

### Key Achievements

**User Mode Selection:** Modal with three persistent options (👤 Personal, 👨‍👩‍👧 Caregiver, 📚 Curious) stored in player progress.

**Personalized Onboarding:** Mode-specific intro steps with dynamic titles, narrative text, and consistent design patterns.

**Mode-Specific Results:** Personalized messaging per user type with tier-specific narratives and hero text.

**In-Game Reflections:** Science facts woven into gameplay with probabilistic display (50% for consume/reject, 20% for optimal).

**Mode-Specific Plot Twists:** Filtered scenario selection by user mode providing contextually relevant challenges.

### Implementation Highlights
- Type-safe user mode configuration with centralized constants
- Enhanced onboarding flow maintaining existing animations
- Mode-filtered reflection system with science education
- Purple-themed plot twist announcements with educational content

    callback: handleVRFFulfillment
  });

  const { randomValue, proof } = await vrfRequest.result;
  const twistIndex = randomValue % plotTwists.length;
  const twist = plotTwists[twistIndex];

  return {
    ...twist,
    fairnessProof: proof,
    isVerifiable: true
  };
}
```
